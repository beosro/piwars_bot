# Camera Design

So the plan will be this:
* The mode button  switches from Tracks drive to Camera track.
* When in camera mode
    * The coloured buttons switch the primary colour - just print the change when it occurs.
    * The joysticks adjust the Saturation and Value.
    * For now - serial will display the output. Later that could be two light strips.
    * Use Xserver to do the OpenCV.
* Mode button to exit.
