Getting the camera working
--------------------------
* I need the picamera library. 
    
    pip install picamera
    
* Now try my skittletrack code - which has had a tiny bit of python 3 adapting.
* No module gpiozero - do we really use it? No - removed.
* Need camera enabled:
    
    picamera.exc.PiCameraError: Camera is not enabled. Try running 'sudo raspi-config' and ensure that the camera has been enabled.

* Tried enabling it in raspi config. Nope. AH - it's not plugged in. Shutdown and fix that.

After refitting and rebooting
-----------------------------

Try again - get it running.

Yes - it works - and tracks!

We have working tracking - for random objects. Need to find HSL values for stuff, but this is a good start.

Single distance sensor
----------------------

It looks like this can be done with rpi gpio (as in Piconzero datasheet) or perhaps with gpiozero.

It was a dependancy of the skittlebot class.

Multiple sensors
----------------

This is going to get interesting. I had a chat with @4tronic on twitter and asked for some ideas.
The PiConZero itself wouldn't be able to, but additional GPIO boards could. So creating a shim to get further
